# Config Directory Restructure Summary

## Completed Restructure
Successfully reorganized the config directory from machine-specific (common/macbook-only/mac-mini-only) to category-based structure for better maintainability and clarity.

## New Structure
```
config/
├── common/
│   ├── aiding/          # AI assistant tools (aider, claude, gemini, slash)
│   ├── editors/         # Code editors (cursor, vscode)
│   ├── runtime/         # Runtimes (nodejs, python, ruby)
│   ├── packages/        # Package lists (Brewfile, images.txt)
│   ├── shell/           # Shell configuration (.zshrc, .zprofile, .zsh/)
│   ├── system/          # macOS system settings
│   ├── vcs/             # Version control systems (git, jj)
│   ├── ssh/             # SSH configuration
│   ├── mcp/             # MCP servers configuration
│   └── docker/          # Docker configuration
└── profiles/
    ├── macbook/         # MacBook-specific settings
    └── mac-mini/        # Mac mini-specific settings
```

## Changes Made
1. Created category-based directory structure in config/common/
2. Moved all files to appropriate category locations
3. Updated justfile with new category-specific path variables:
   - `pkg_path := config_common / "packages"`
   - `aiding_path := config_common / "aiding"`
   - `editors_path := config_common / "editors"`
   - `runtime_path := config_common / "runtime"`
   - `vcs_path := config_common / "vcs"`
4. Updated all justfile recipes to use new paths
5. Verified Ansible playbooks work with new structure
6. Updated README.md documentation
7. Machine-specific configs moved to config/profiles/

## Benefits
- Intuitive organization by function/category
- Easy to find and maintain specific configurations
- Clear separation of common vs machine-specific settings
- Scalable structure for adding new tools/configurations
- Maintains all existing automation functionality

## Testing Status
- ✅ Individual commands (just cmn-git) work correctly
- ✅ File symlinks are created properly  
- ✅ All automation preserved
- ✅ Clean directory structure with no orphaned files
