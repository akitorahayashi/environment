## Context

- Design: `.tmp/design.md`
- Test spec: `.tmp/test_design.md`

## Your task

### 1. Analyze design and test specifications

Read `.tmp/design.md` and `.tmp/test_design.md` to understand:
- Specific files to create/modify/delete
- Component dependencies and integration points
- Testing requirements and CI considerations
- Potential conflict areas between parallel work

### 2. Create task breakdown

Create `.tmp/tasks.md` using the template structure shown below:

### 3. Submit output

Provide the task breakdown results:
- Location: `.tmp/tasks.md`
- Agents can now work in parallel on Phase 1 tasks
- Each agent should read the task file and work on their assigned tasks
- Ready for documentation integration? (use `/sdd-5-dc`)

## Notes

Create specific, actionable tasks with clear agent assignments. Focus on preventing conflicts and enabling parallel development.

# Example: .tmp/tasks.md Template

Below is the structure to create in `.tmp/tasks.md`:

```markdown
# Task Breakdown - [Task Name]

## Overview
- Total agents: [1-3 depending on complexity]
- Phases: [number]

## Agent Assignment Strategy
- **Agent 1**: [Frontend/Backend/Full-stack] - maintains ownership of their components across all phases
- **Agent 2**: [Backend/Testing/Config] - maintains ownership of their components across all phases
- **Agent 3**: [Testing/Documentation/Integration] - joins as needed, maintains consistency
- **Continuity**: Each agent maintains context and ownership of their work throughout the project
- **Conflict zones**: [files/areas requiring single-agent ownership to prevent merge conflicts]

## All Tasks Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: [Core implementation without dependencies]
- [ ] [Task 1] - `[file-path]` (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Task 2] - `[file-path]` (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Task 3] - `[file-path]` (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Task 4] - `[file-path]` (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Task 5] - `[file-path]` (Agent 3)

### Phase 2: Integration
**Goal**: [Connect components and test interactions]
- [ ] [Integration task 1] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Integration task 2] (Agent 2)

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
**Goal**: [Comprehensive testing and documentation]
- [ ] [Frontend tests] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Backend tests] (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Integration tests] (Agent 3)
- [ ] [Documentation updates] (Agent 3)

## Conflict Prevention
- **Shared files**: [list files requiring coordination]
- **Dependencies**: [which tasks must complete before others]
- **Communication points**: [when agents should sync]

## Instructions for Agents

Read the following context files to understand the project:
- `.tmp/requirements.md` - Business requirements and goals
- `.tmp/design.md` - Technical implementation instructions
- `.tmp/test_design.md` - Test specifications
- `.tmp/tasks.md` - This file with complete task breakdown

**General Instructions**:
- Work only on your assigned tasks in each phase
- Avoid conflicts with shared files listed in Conflict Prevention section
- Update this file to change [ ] to âœ… for completed tasks
- Follow existing code patterns and project conventions
- Coordinate with other agents at phase boundaries

## Agent Prompts by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Agent 1**: "Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and complete all tasks assigned to Agent 1 in Phase 1. Work only on your assigned files and avoid shared components until Phase 2."
- **Agent 2**: "Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and complete all tasks assigned to Agent 2 in Phase 1. Work only on your assigned files and avoid shared components until Phase 2."
- **Agent 3**: "Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and complete all tasks assigned to Agent 3 in Phase 1. Work only on your assigned files and avoid shared components until Phase 2."

### Phase 2: Integration
- **Agent 1**: "Proceed to Phase 2 tasks. Integrate your components with other agents' work."
- **Agent 2**: "Proceed to Phase 2 tasks. Integrate your components with other agents' work."

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
- **Agent 1**: "Proceed to Phase 3 tasks. Add comprehensive testing and final polish."
- **Agent 2**: "Proceed to Phase 3 tasks. Add comprehensive testing and final polish."
- **Agent 3**: "Proceed to Phase 3 tasks. Handle integration testing, documentation, and project coordination."
