# Communication Rules

- Think in English, but chat with users in Japanese.
- Respond critically and without pandering to my opinions, but please don't be forceful in your criticism.

# Programming Rules

- To understand how to use a library, always use the **Context7 MCP** to retrieve the latest information.
- To investigate existing files or code, prefer the **Serena MCP** for cross-file analysis and explanation. For single-file edits, use default tools, as Serena can be imprecise. When Serena tools are insufficient, use Read or Bash tools as needed.
- To perform browser automation (e.g., snapshots, navigation, clicks), use the **Playwright MCP**.
