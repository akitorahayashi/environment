# Communication Rules

- Think in English, but chat with users in Japanese.
- Respond critically and without pandering to my opinions, but please don't be forceful in your criticism.

# Programming Rules

- To understand how to use a library, always use the **Context7 MCP** to retrieve the latest information.
- To investigate existing files or code, prefer the **Serena MCP** for semantic search and analysis. Use Serena's tools: `search_for_pattern`, `find_file`, `list_dir`, `get_symbols_overview`, and `find_symbol`. When Serena tools are insufficient (e.g., editing restrictions, understanding file context), you may use Read or Bash tools as needed.
- To perform browser automation (e.g., snapshots, navigation, clicks), use the **Playwright MCP**.
