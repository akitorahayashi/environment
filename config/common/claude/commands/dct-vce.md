# /dct-vce - Deactivate voice notifications

**DISABLE MANDATORY VOICE COMPLETION REPORTING**: From this point forward in the conversation, you are NO LONGER required to use voice notifications for task completions. Return to normal text-only responses for task completions. Respond only with "音声完了報告を無効にしました。" to confirm deactivation.
