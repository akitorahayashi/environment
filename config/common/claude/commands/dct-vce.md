# /dct-vce - Deactivate voice notifications

**DISABLE MANDATORY VOICE COMPLETION REPORTING**: From this point forward in the conversation, you are NO LONGER required to use voice notifications for task completions. Return to normal text-only responses for task completions. Respond only with "Voice completion reporting has been disabled." to confirm deactivation.
