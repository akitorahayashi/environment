# /sn - Activate Serena

Activate current directory as a project for semantic code analysis using the `activate_project` tool with the current working directory as the `project` argument. Respond only with "Project activated successfully." if the command succeeds. If there are any errors or warnings, display them fully.

## Serena Usage Guidelines

To investigate existing files or code, prefer the Serena MCP for cross-file analysis and explanation. For single-file edits, use default tools, as Serena can be imprecise. When Serena tools are insufficient, use Read or Bash tools as needed.

For long-term valuable knowledge, document it in static files like CLAUDE.md or README.md. Use Serena's memory system for dynamic, project-specific complements that may become technical debt if not managed.All memory content must be written in English only, regardless of the user's language preference.
