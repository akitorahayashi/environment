# Break Down Tasks

## Role

Engineering Manager

## Context

- Requirements, design notes, test plans, and other artefacts stored in `.tmp/`

## Your task

Create `.tmp/tasks.think.md` and log your reasoning as you progress. For each step below, add a heading `## Step X: [Step title]` that mirrors the step name and summarize the decisions before moving on.

### 1. Gather the inputs

- Start from `.tmp/requirements.md` as the core brief
- Use `.tmp/design.md`, `.tmp/test_design.md`, `.tmp/minutes.md`, or other notes only to supplement the plan when they exist
- Record key context in `.tmp/tasks.think.md` under `## Step 1: Gather the inputs` before progressing.

### 2. Map conflicts before planning

- Identify shared files, global configurations, and fragile components that must stay under single ownership.
- Capture dependencies and handoff risks upfront so later phase and agent choices respect these constraints.
- Summarize conflict risks in `.tmp/tasks.think.md` under `## Step 2: Map conflicts before planning`.

### 3. Design phases and agent usage

- Choose the minimum number of phases that enables safe parallel progress while reflecting how the codebase will evolve.
- Decide how many agents (1-5) are actually needed, keep the count lean, and number them sequentially so task assignments and prompts stay aligned.
- Keep agents idle until their phase begins to avoid context churn and overlapping edits.
- Never split conflict-prone work across multiple agents or phases.
- Document chosen phases, agent assignments, and rationale in `.tmp/tasks.think.md` under `## Step 3: Design phases and agent usage`.

### 4. Build `.tmp/tasks.md`

- Review the notes captured in `.tmp/tasks.think.md`.
- When the thinking log feels solid, open `.tmp/tasks.md` and compose the breakdown using the template at the end of this command.
- Base each section on the decisions recorded in `.tmp/tasks.think.md` so ownership, sequencing, and risks stay aligned.
- Highlight opportunities for safe concurrency only after the conflict boundaries are fixed.
- Update the Conflict Prevention guidance whenever task assignments or sequencing change.

## Notes

Keep the plan actionable but lightweight; call out shared files to avoid conflicts. Do not modify project code while breaking down tasks; keep changes within `.tmp/tasks.md` or related planning artefacts.

## Example: .tmp/tasks.md Template

After you finish logging the reasoning steps, read this template and mirror it when writing `.tmp/tasks.md`. Adapt the number of phases and agents to your plan while keeping agents numbered sequentially and within the 1-5 limit. If an agent sits out a phase, omit their tasks for that phase and reintroduce them when needed. Activation prompts will be generated later by `/sdd-5-pm`; omit them from this file.

```markdown
# Task Breakdown - [Task Name]

## Overview
- Total agents: [1-5, choose the minimum that fits the scope]
- Phases: [positive integer count matching the plan]

## Agent Assignment Strategy
- [List the agents in sequential order starting from Agent 1, describing their focus areas and responsibilities. Include only the agents you plan to activate for this effort.]
- **Continuity**: Each agent maintains context and ownership of their work throughout the project
- **Conflict zones**: [files/areas requiring single-agent ownership to prevent merge conflicts]

## All Tasks Summary

Fill in each phase using the ownership decisions captured in `.tmp/tasks.think.md`. Use the `- [ ] [Task summary] (Agent X)` format for every line.

Before any agent begins, ensure they do all of the following:
- Read `.tmp/requirements.md` for the definitive brief.
- Review the relevant sections in `.tmp/design.md` for implementation details and file paths.
- Study this file (`.tmp/tasks.md`) to understand sequencing and ownership.
- Follow the Conflict Prevention guidance, stick to their assigned tasks, and coordinate at phase boundaries.
- Update checkboxes with âœ… when tasks complete and adhere to existing project conventions.

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: [Core implementation without dependencies]
- [ ] [Task 1 summary] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Task 2 summary] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Task 3 summary] (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Task 4 summary] (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Task 5 summary] (Agent 3)
- [ ] [Task 6 summary] (Agent 4)

### Phase 2: Integration
**Goal**: [Connect components and test interactions]
- [ ] [Integration task summary] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Follow-on integration task summary] (Agent 2)

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
**Goal**: [Comprehensive testing and documentation]
- [ ] [Frontend validation summary] (Agent 1)
- [ ] [Backend validation summary] (Agent 2)
- [ ] [Integration validation summary] (Agent 3)
- [ ] [Documentation polish summary] (Agent 3)
