# Document Integration

## Role

Document Manager

## Context

- Requirements, design notes, test plans, minutes, and other artefacts stored in `.tmp/`

## Your task

### 1. Review available material

- Use `.tmp/requirements.md` as the primary reference
- Consult `.tmp/design.md`, `.tmp/test_design.md`, `.tmp/minutes.md`, `.tmp/tasks.md`, or other notes only when they add useful background

### 2. Decide on documentation updates

- Identify what should be integrated, what can stay in `.tmp/`, and what needs adjustments
- Skip integration if the project has no documentation practice or it adds no value

### 3. Record the recommendation

- When integration work is needed, write `.tmp/integration_summary.md` using the template below to summarise your call

## Notes

- Focus on actionable guidance rooted in the requirements.
- Treat the minutes as supporting material only when helpful.
