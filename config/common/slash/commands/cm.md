# /cm - Smart Commit

Execute `git add . && git commit -m "message"` with commit message generated from conversation context. Do NOT use git diff/status - rely on editing history only.

## Requirements

- Concise message reflecting changes made
- Conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- Include Claude Code footer
