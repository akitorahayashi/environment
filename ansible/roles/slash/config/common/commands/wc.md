# /wc - Plan and Execute Tasks

Perform critical planning to create a robust execution strategy, and then immediately execute that strategy.

This command is for complex tasks where the path forward is not immediately clear and requires strategic thought before action.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Critical Planning

1.  **Analyze Goal:** Study the user's request and any existing plan in `.tmp/tasks.md`.
2.  **Stress-Test Plan:** Explore alternatives, evaluate dependencies, and identify risks.
3.  **Validate or Refine Plan:** Confirm the existing plan is sound. If necessary, rewrite `.tmp/tasks.md` to make it more robust.

### Phase 2: Execution

4.  **Implement:** Execute the newly defined plan from `.tmp/tasks.md`.
5.  **Verify:** Run tests and validations to confirm the implementation is successful.
