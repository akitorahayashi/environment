# /wc - Work on Tasks (Critical Planning)

Review `.tmp/tasks.md` to internalize the intent of the plan. Reflect on the underlying goals, explore alternative approaches, and decide whether the current plan remains optimal. If a better path exists, adjust the plan before executing the tasks to ensure the work proceeds in the best possible way.
