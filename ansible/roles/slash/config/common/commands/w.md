# /w - Execute Tasks

Directly execute tasks based on the user's request or an existing plan in `.tmp/tasks.md`.

This command is for direct action. It assumes the plan is clear and does not require a deep critical planning phase.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify Tasks:** Review the user's request and/or the plan in `.tmp/tasks.md`.
2.  **Implement:** Execute the required changes by writing code, running commands, or modifying files.
3.  **Verify:** Run relevant tests and validations to confirm the changes work as expected.
