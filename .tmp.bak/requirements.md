# Requirements - MCP Configuration Synchronization

## Goal
Ensure the Codex configuration distributed by automation always reflects the authoritative MCP server definitions while preserving other Codex settings.

## Users
- Platform engineers who run the common configuration automation
- Developers relying on consistent Codex + MCP setups across machines

## Must Have
- [ ] Automation updates the Codex configuration with the latest MCP server definitions whenever a local Codex config exists.
- [ ] The update process preserves all non-MCP Codex settings and avoids overwriting when no local source is available.
- [ ] Operational guidance clarifies that the Codex setup step precedes the MCP synchronization to guarantee prerequisites.

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Automated verification that the synchronized configuration matches the authoritative MCP server list before completion.
- [ ] Documentation outlining how to extend the MCP server catalog without breaking synchronization.

## Success
- Running the standard automation sequence results in repository and user Codex configurations containing the current MCP server list with no manual edits required, and other Codex settings remain unchanged.

## Notes
- Synchronization is conditional on the presence of the userâ€™s Codex configuration or its symlink; absence should leave repository files untouched.
- Any schema references unavailable in the repo (e.g., missing documentation files) must be validated or recreated before extending the MCP catalog.
- Recipe sequencing (e.g., Codex before MCP) may be enforced through process documentation or combined automation targets.
